# Overview

* scraper.py contains the scraping functions and downloads json details 
individual restuarants
* review_scraper.py downloads reviews from all cities

The first thing we scraped was the all_city_data file which gives on the links
to the individual reviews we want to scrape.

What are all of the data files?

* `review_response_list.pickle` is a list of raw review responses generated by
the `review_scraper.py` file. 
* `author_review_dict.pickle` contains combinations of reviews and authors in 
a dictionary format
* `all_city_data.pickle` contains data on individual restuarants in all cities
* `city_data_df.pickle` is only 9 rows long and just contains some basic information
on all of the cities that are covered
